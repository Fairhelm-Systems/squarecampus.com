/**
 * Enquiry journeys and their copy.
 *
 * One form component, three entry points, each on its own page so each
 * journey has one heading and one next step (audit SC-026, SC-027):
 *
 *  - `demo`             → /demo/                              "Book a demo"
 *  - `founding-partner` → /launch-partners/#request-diagnosis  partnership diagnosis
 *  - `proposal`         → /pricing/#request-proposal           "Request a proposal"
 *
 * Previously /demo/ rendered the demo and founding-partner variants into one
 * <h1> and hid one with CSS, so extracted text concatenated both headings.
 * Old links to /demo/?intent=founding-partner still work: the tiny script
 * below forwards them to the founding-partner form.
 *
 * Claim discipline is the same as /launch-partners/ (see
 * content/founding-partners.ts): no equity or investment language, no
 * exclusivity, no guaranteed outcome, no published price.
