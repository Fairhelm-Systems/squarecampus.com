/**
 * Pages that ship a Markdown alternate for agents.
 *
 * The Markdown is generated after `next build` by scripts/markdown-alternates.ts
 * from the rendered HTML of each page — the same source the browser gets, with
 * navigation, footer and decorative UI removed — so there is no second
 * hand-written copy to maintain. Each page here advertises its alternate with
 * `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">` (see lib/seo.ts), and
 * /llms.txt links to the Markdown URL.
 *
 * URL convention (llms.txt): directory-style pages get `<path>/index.md`.
 * The home page is `/index.md`.
 *
 * Keep this list to the pages a buyer or an agent evaluates from — the
 * generator and the build check both walk it, so every entry must be a real,
 * indexable route.
