/**
 * Search-intent pages.
 *
 * One page per query cluster a school buyer actually types. Each lives at a
 * flat keyword slug (`/fee-management-software-for-schools/`) and is rendered
 * by `src/app/(company)/[intent]/page.tsx`. `scripts/check-content.ts` reads
 * this same array, so a page cannot ship without its definition block, at
 * least four workflows, four FAQs, and resolvable related links.
 *
 * Writing rules (the claims gate enforces the hard ones):
 * - The `definition` is a direct 40–70 word answer to "what is X". It is the
 *   part search engines lift into a snippet, so it must stand alone.
 * - Vendor-neutral where the query is neutral: the `evaluation` list is what
 *   any buyer should check of any vendor, including us.
 * - No customer counts, rankings, fixed timelines, or certifications. Security
 *   language stays at "designed to"; see docs/marketing-claims-register.md.
 * - Every page links out to the platform, the category page, one comparison
 *   and one post, so the graph is dense in both directions.
