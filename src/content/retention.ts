/**
 * Data retention: the public content for /data-retention/ and every retention
 * pointer elsewhere on the site (pricing, FAQ, llms.txt).
 *
 * RULES OF THIS FILE
 * - This is a public repository surface. Legal research, proposed periods,
 *   reviewer identities, sign-off evidence and open legal questions are kept
 *   outside the repository. Nothing researched-but-unreviewed belongs here.
 * - A retention rule reaches the public schedule only through
 *   `publicRetentionSchedule()`, which admits a rule only when its review is
 *   complete for the exact version recorded. A citation is not legal sign-off,
 *   and approval of website wording is not legal review.
 * - No invented periods, deadlines, formats, storage amounts or turnaround
 *   times. No date arithmetic and no deletion-eligibility logic: this site
 *   describes retention, it does not decide it.
 * - Confirmed arrangements and matters awaiting confirmation are kept apart,
 *   and the page renders them apart.
