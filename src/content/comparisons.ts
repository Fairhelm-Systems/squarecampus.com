 * - The SquareCampus column states our own product facts.
 * - Competitor cells contain ONLY publicly verifiable facts (sourced from each
 *   vendor's public materials, as of the date below). Never invent pricing,
 *   uptime, or missing-feature claims — India residency and mobile apps are
 *   table stakes every major vendor meets, so they are not framed as our edge.
 * - Every page renders the disclaimer + competitor link so readers can verify.
