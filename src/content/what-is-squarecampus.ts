    question: "Is SquareCampus an ERP?",
    answer: `Yes, in the sense buyers usually mean. ${product.categoryRelationship} "School OS" describes how it is built: school cycles, ownership, exceptions, governance and leadership visibility share one institutional model.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is a School Operating System?",
    answer:
      "A School Operating System is the connected operating backbone an institution runs on. It holds the records a school expects, but it also carries the workflows, ownership, approvals, exceptions and audit history that turn those records into accountable day-to-day operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an institutional decision layer?",
    answer:
      "A system of record stores what happened. A decision layer shows what requires attention, why it matters, who owns it, and what happens next. SquareCampus is built to do both, so leadership does not have to assemble context before acting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is SquareCampus built for?",
    answer:
      "Indian schools, educational trusts, church-run school groups and multi-campus institutions, and higher-education institutions as a governed layer over the systems they already run. It suits institutions that care about operational control, accountable ownership and leadership visibility — whether they run one campus or many. It is not designed for an institution that needs only basic attendance, fees and report cards at the lowest possible price.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is AEGIS a chatbot?",
    answer:
      "No. AEGIS is the governed intelligence layer inside SquareCampus. It produces permission-scoped, source-grounded and auditable operational answers from institutional context. It is read-only, constrained by the asker's existing role permissions, and does not take autonomous decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can SquareCampus replace our existing school ERP?",
    answer:
      "Institutions commonly move to SquareCampus from a school ERP, a set of disconnected tools, or a mix of both. Migration scope, sequencing and how long the existing system runs alongside are agreed during discovery rather than assumed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does SquareCampus mean by governance, exception ownership and accountability?",
    answer:
      "Governance is policy, approval chains, role boundaries and audit history held as institutional configuration. Exception ownership means a deviation from the expected state becomes a routed item with a named owner, a position and a due date. Accountability means every approval, override and closure is attributed to a person and a role, recorded with the reason, on an append-only timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does multi-campus governance differ from supporting multiple campuses?",
    answer:
      "Supporting multiple campuses means the software can hold several campuses' records. Multi-campus governance means trust, school and campus are one hierarchy: policy is set once and executed locally with deviations recorded as exceptions, access scope is a property of the role, and exceptions and board views cross campuses from the same records without consolidation.",
