        heading: "Implementations fail on data and time, not on features",
        paragraphs: [
          "Ask anyone who has lived through a painful school ERP implementation what went wrong, and you will rarely hear about a missing feature. You will hear about student records that arrived half-clean. About teachers trained in a rush during exam week. About a fee cycle that began before anyone had checked the new receipts. The software mostly worked. The change around it was never planned. That is the honest starting point for this guide: an implementation is an operating exercise for the whole school, not a technical task the vendor performs somewhere offstage.",
          "Most schools plan the opposite way. They spend months comparing feature lists, then treat the implementation as a formality — something the vendor ‘handles’ once the contract is signed. But the vendor cannot clean your data, cannot free your staff’s time, and cannot move your exam schedule. Those three things decide whether the project lands, and all three sit on the school’s side of the table. Any vendor who tells you otherwise is selling you the demo, not the outcome. The sooner both sides say this out loud, the smoother everything that follows becomes.",
          "So this guide walks through what actually happens, phase by phase: the blueprint, the data cleaning, role-based training, the parallel run, the staged go-live, and the follow-through afterwards. It is written for the people who will carry the work — IT coordinators, office managers, principals — and it is useful whichever product you buy. Wherever a term of trade appears, we define it in plain words as we go, because half the anxiety in these projects comes from vocabulary nobody bothered to explain.",

        heading: "Begin with a blueprint of how your school actually runs",
        paragraphs: [
          "Before anything is installed or imported, someone must write down how the school really operates today — not the official version, the real one. Call this the blueprint: a plain document listing your classes and sections, your fee structure with every concession and instalment pattern, who approves what, which registers and spreadsheets hold which records, and where the exceptions hide. The blueprint is the map the whole implementation follows. Every argument you will ever have — about a fee head, a report format, a permission — is far cheaper to have now, on paper, than later, live.",
          "This is joint work. The vendor brings the questions; the school brings the answers, and only certain people have them. Your accountant knows the fee structure that actually gets applied, including the quiet concessions no document mentions. Your admissions in-charge knows how enrolment really flows, form to confirmation. Your exam coordinator knows the report card the board actually requires. Budget real sittings with these people, in working hours, with their routine work covered. The most common blueprint mistake is sending one junior IT person to speak for an entire office that was never asked.",
          "A good blueprint also forces early decisions. Will your campuses share one fee-head naming or keep their own? What exactly counts as an ‘active student’? Who may edit a record after it has been approved? Settle these definitions before a single record moves, and get them written into the blueprint with names against them. Definitions that stay vague at this stage do not disappear. They resurface during the parallel run as mismatched numbers, and during go-live week as arguments — at the worst possible time to be having them.",

          "Data migration simply means moving your existing records — students, staff, fee histories, marks — out of the old software and spreadsheets and into the new system. It is the phase schools underestimate most, because the hard part is not the moving. It is the cleaning. Years of records accumulate duplicates, gaps, and quiet inconsistencies: the same parent under three phone numbers, siblings linked in one register and not another, fee arrears that live only in a clerk’s memory. Moving mess into new software gives you well-organised mess. Nothing more.",
          "Here is the division of labour no brochure states plainly. The vendor can convert formats, map fields, and run the imports. The vendor cannot tell you which of those three phone numbers is current, whether ‘Aarav S.’ in the fee register is the same child as ‘Arav Sharma’ in the admission file, or which old records still matter. Only your staff can decide that. So the honest split is this: the vendor maps and moves; the school decides and corrects. Plan for your office staff to spend real desk hours on this, and protect those hours.",
          "Two rules keep the work sane. First, for every kind of record, name a single source that wins — the ‘system of record’, meaning the one place where a fact is considered official when copies disagree. Second, migrate what the school actively runs on, and archive the rest rather than importing a decade of history nobody will open. A few checks are worth doing before anything moves at all.",

A projector, a hundred chairs, a vendor demonstrating every module to everyone at once — and three weeks later, the front office is still calling the one person who took notes. People do not learn software by watching it. They learn by doing their own work in it, with someone nearby to unstick them. Training that ignores this produces a school that technically owns new software and practically still runs on the old habits.",
          "Role-based training flips the format. Each group practises only the workflows it will actually run, on realistic data, performing real tasks: the accounts team collects a fee and prints the receipt; a teacher marks today’s attendance and enters a test’s marks; the front office registers a walk-in enquiry end to end. Small groups, working sessions, repeated short rather than delivered once long. Insist that your vendor structures training this way, and schedule it close to go-live — skills trained months early evaporate before they are ever used.",
          "One more role deserves deliberate attention: your in-house anchors. Every school has a few staff members who take to new systems quickly and whom colleagues already ask for help. Identify them early, train them deepest, and give them standing to answer questions after the vendor’s trainer has gone home. The schools where new systems stick are almost always the ones where help sits two desks away, not at the end of a support line.",

It exists so that the cutover, the day the new system becomes the official one and the old one stops being maintained, is a confirmation rather than a leap of faith. If the new system’s fee collections match the old register to the rupee for a full billing cycle, switching over is a decision backed by evidence. If they do not match, you have found the problem while the old system still protects you.",
          "Before the parallel run, most projects include user acceptance testing, or UAT — a stage where your own staff try their daily tasks in the new system and formally confirm each one behaves the way the school needs, before real operations depend on it. Treat UAT as the school’s veto, not the vendor’s checkbox. The people signing off should be the people who will live with the result: the accountant approves the fee workflows, a teacher approves attendance and marks entry, the front office approves admissions. Written sign-off per workflow, by name.",
          "Be honest with yourself about the cost. Parallel running means double entry for the staff involved, and double entry is tiring. So do not parallel-run everything — choose the workflows where a silent error would genuinely hurt, run those thoroughly, and let low-risk workflows go live on UAT alone. A vendor who resists parallel running for your finance data is telling you something. So, in fairness, is a school that refuses to staff it.",

Stage by workflow: attendance first, perhaps, then admissions, then fees once the parallel run has earned your confidence. Or stage by campus: one branch proves the path before the others follow. Each stage is small enough to watch closely, and small enough to pause. The big-bang alternative — everything, everywhere, on one Monday — concentrates every risk you have into a single morning.",
          "Every stage needs a way back, agreed in writing before you start. A rollback plan states what happens if a stage fails: which system resumes being official, who declares it, and how any records entered in the interim are carried across. You will probably never use it. Having it changes behaviour anyway — staff commit more willingly to a change they know is reversible, and vendors plan more carefully when reversal is on the table. Keep the old system readable until well after the final stage, even after it stops taking new entries.",
          "Note what staging does not require: switching everything off. A bounded deployment can run alongside the systems the school already depends on — the existing ERP, the payment portal, the identity provider — with those systems remaining authoritative for what they do. Consolidating onto fewer tools is a choice the institution can make later, workflow by workflow, when the evidence supports it. Be wary of any implementation plan that only works if everything old is ripped out on day one. That is the vendor’s convenience wearing your risk.",

          "An Indian school year is not evenly busy. It has surges — admission season, fee due weeks, board and internal exams, results — when the office runs at capacity and nobody has an hour spare. Implementations fail by colliding with these surges more often than they fail for any technical reason. The staff who must clean data, attend training, and double-enter a parallel run are exactly the staff those surges consume. So the sequencing question is not ‘how fast can we go?’ but ‘which weeks can this school actually give?’",
          "Some collisions are simply not worth risking. Do not attempt a cutover of admissions workflows in the middle of admission season, when the enquiry counter is the school’s front line. Do not switch fee systems during the due weeks at the start of a term, when collection queues and reconciliation pressure peak together. Do not schedule training or parallel runs across board exam windows or the results crunch, when teachers and coordinators have nothing left to give. In most schools these pressure points are entirely predictable — a wall calendar and honesty will locate every one of them.",
          "The better pattern: place the heavy staff-time phases — training, UAT, the parallel run — in the genuinely quieter stretches of your particular calendar, and time each workflow’s go-live so it starts just before that workflow’s natural cycle begins fresh, fully validated, rather than mid-storm. A new fee cycle beginning cleanly on the new system beats a mid-cycle switch every time. This is also why a fixed universal timeline is a red flag rather than a comfort: the right sequence depends on your calendar, and a vendor promising the same number of weeks to every school has not looked at yours.",

A teacher keeps marks in a personal spreadsheet and enters them into the system later, sometimes. A campus quietly builds its own workaround for approvals. None of this is sabotage — it is busy people reaching for what feels safe. But every workaround splits your records in two, and the single source of truth you implemented erodes one habit at a time.",
          "Adoption follow-through is the deliberate work of preventing that slide, and it deserves the same planning as the migration did. Review each workflow after its first full real cycle — the first complete fee term, the first exam, the first admission intake — and compare what the system says happened with what staff actually did. Retire old registers and spreadsheets formally, with a date, rather than letting them linger as shadow systems. Keep your in-house anchors active, and keep a named person on the vendor’s side reachable, because the questions that surface in month three are the real ones.",
          "Measure adoption honestly. Not ‘is the system live?’ but: are receipts issued only from the system? Is attendance entered the same day it is taken? Do leadership reports come from the system directly, or from a spreadsheet someone still assembles by hand? When those answers are yes, the implementation is finished. Not before.",

Can go-live be staged by workflow and by campus, with a written rollback plan per stage? And will you sequence around our academic calendar — can you tell us, from our calendar, which weeks you would refuse to touch? Vendors comfortable with these questions tend to be comfortable with the work.",

Yet that is exactly when it is cheapest to negotiate, because nobody is upset yet and nothing is at stake.",

In what format? Who does the work? Who pays for it? How long will it take? And what happens to the copies the old vendor keeps? If those answers are not already written into the contract, they get settled by negotiation at the worst possible moment — after the relationship has cooled and the vendor has no commercial reason to hurry.",

An export that arrives months late can sink the whole migration, because the new vendor cannot load what it has not received. The fix is not suspicion; it is arithmetic done in advance. Agree at signing what an export costs — ideally nothing for standard formats — and how many days after a written request it will be delivered.

The other half is what happens to the copies the vendor keeps — in their live systems, in their backups, sometimes in their reporting tools. ‘We will delete it’ is easy to say and impossible to see. The practical question is whether deletion can be evidenced: will the vendor confirm in writing, at a named point in time, that your institution’s data has been removed from live systems, and state the schedule on which it will age out of backups?",

Under India’s data protection law, the DPDP Act, a school remains accountable for the personal data of its students and parents even while a vendor holds that data on the school’s behalf. In general terms, that means return and deletion are not favours a vendor grants; they are part of what a school needs from any vendor in order to meet its own obligations. This is context, not legal advice — but it is a strong reason to put deletion in writing.",

The note migrates to the bottom of a tray. The parent, hearing nothing, visits the school two streets away — which called back the same evening.",

Cheques are receipted on presentation but realised days later — or bounce after the receipt has already gone home in the diary. Cash still moves at the counter, entered in a register and typed into software after the rush. A multi-campus trust may run separate accounts per campus on top of all of this.",
          "Each channel produces a record with its own shape, timing, and failure mode. A parent pays the annual fee by NEFT and the credit appears as ‘NEFT-UTR-XXXX’ with no admission number. A UPI payment succeeds but the gateway’s callback to the fee portal fails, so the parent holds a debit and the school holds a pending invoice. A grandparent pays for two grandchildren in one transfer. The gateway’s settlement report nets out its charges, so the bank credit never equals the sum of the receipts.",

A mismatch is not an error to be embarrassed about; it is the expected daily product of the system. The question that separates well-run fee operations from stressed ones is not ‘how do we prevent mismatches’ but ‘what happens to a mismatch in the first hour of its life’.",

Then the school communication app arrived, and sending became free. A circular that once needed printing and distribution now takes thirty seconds and reaches every phone in the school. So schools send more: reminders, greetings, photos, appeals, corrections to earlier messages. The load the app promised to reduce has simply moved onto parents, and it has grown on the way there.",
          "Notification fatigue is the core failure, and it is worth naming plainly: when everything arrives as a notification, nothing reads as important. The fee reminder looks exactly like the sports-day photo — same chime, same banner, same red dot. A parent who receives several of these a day does the only sensible thing and mutes the app. Then they miss the one message with a real consequence, the school telephones them, and the office is now running two channels — the app and the phone — where it used to run one.",
          "None of this is parental carelessness. It is a rational response to a channel that mixes the urgent with the decorative and offers no way to tell them apart. The fix is not sending less for its own sake, and it is certainly not a louder chime.

An addressed message is different in kind, not just in reach: it is about this parent, this child, this action, and this deadline. ‘Dear parents, kindly clear pending fees’ is a broadcast; most parents reading it have already paid, so all of them learn to skim it. ‘Your daughter’s term-two fee is unpaid and is due this Friday’ is addressed. It cannot be skimmed, because it is visibly about your own child.",
          "Most school apps make broadcasting effortless and addressing laborious, so schools broadcast by default. The result is a channel where nearly every message is, for any given parent, about somebody else. Parents are not ignoring the school; they are correctly predicting that the next notification does not concern them. Every irrelevant broadcast spends a little of the channel’s credibility, and credibility is the only thing a communication channel really has. Guard it the way you guard the school’s name.",
          "A useful discipline: before sending, ask whether the message changes what any specific parent must do.

They exist because the official app failed at something — usually two-way conversation — and they work, which is exactly the problem. Marks, medical details, photographs of children, and complaints about named students circulate in groups whose membership nobody controls and whose history nobody at the school can see. Student data leaks not through hackers but through forwarding.",

When a dispute arrives — about what was announced, when, and to whom — the school cannot produce the conversation, because it lives on a teacher’s personal phone. When that teacher leaves, the channel and its history leave with them. The institution has outsourced its most active parent channel to individual handsets. The security page at squarecampus.com/security/ describes what institutional custody of communication data should look like; the short version is that a school channel should belong to the school.",
          "The answer is not a circular banning WhatsApp groups; bans fail because the groups meet a real need. The answer is an official channel good enough that the unofficial one becomes unnecessary — one where a parent can ask a question and get an answer, in their own language, on the record. Until that exists, every ban simply pushes the groups further out of sight, where the data risk is the same and the school’s visibility is worse.",

Disabling replies stopped the flood, and rebuilt the very wall the app was meant to remove. Parents who cannot reply in the app do not stop having questions. They phone, they visit, or they ask in the WhatsApp group, which is exactly how the unofficial network gets its power back.",
          "The alternative to disabling replies is routing them. A reply should never land in a general pool; it should land with an owner and acquire a due position — a visible answer to the question ‘who has this, and by when will they respond?’. That closes the accountability gap that makes parents distrust official channels. Today, a parent’s question typically has no owner and no due position, so asking feels like posting a letter into the sea.

Some parents read fluently, some read little, and most read hurriedly on a phone between tasks.

The real test of a fee reminder is not whether it sounds official; it is whether the least comfortable reader in the class knows exactly what to do after reading it.",

Every unclear or unfindable message the school sends becomes a phone call it must answer later, one at a time, during the hours when the office is busiest with everything else.",
          "The other recurring category is disputes: ‘we never received the fee reminder’, ‘nobody told us about the uniform change’. Without records these become arguments about memory, and the school loses them by default, because it cannot show otherwise.

Not by winning the argument, but by replacing the argument with a lookup that both sides can see.",
          "This is why communication belongs inside the school’s operating layer rather than in a standalone messaging tool.

A well-kept workbook is a serious piece of work, and a school that runs on workbooks is usually running on the dedication of two or three people who know them cell by cell. If that is your school, nothing here is aimed at you. It is aimed at a moment — a specific, recognisable moment — when the tool stops fitting the job it has been quietly doing for years.",
          "That moment has nothing to do with fashion or technology cycles. It comes from four structural limits built into what a spreadsheet is: no row has an owner, no cell has a history, copies multiply the moment a file is shared, and the knowledge of how it all works lives in one person’s head. Each limit is invisible while a school is small. Each one becomes expensive as it grows. The rest of this post walks through them one at a time.",

Whose job is that row? The honest answer in most offices is: whoever happens to notice it. A spreadsheet can record that a case exists, but it cannot assign the case to a person, and it cannot object when nobody moves it. Accountability — knowing exactly who is responsible for finishing a piece of work — is not a column you can add.",
          "You can see the symptom in the tracker itself. Columns added by four different people across four admission seasons: one for ‘called?’, one for ‘remarks’, one for ‘remarks 2’, one that nobody remembers adding. Each column is a well-meant attempt to make the sheet carry responsibility. None of them works, because a cell saying a particular clerk should follow up does not notify that clerk, does not remind them, and does not escalate to anyone when the week passes. The sheet holds information. It cannot hold anyone to anything.",
          "The cost is quiet. There is no crash and no error message — just an enquiry that goes cold, a transfer certificate that sits unissued, a concession request a parent has to raise three times. Small schools absorb this because everyone knows everything. Past a few hundred students, ‘everyone knows everything’ stops being true, and the rows with no owner start turning into phone calls to the principal — usually during admission season, when open cases are at their peak and the office’s attention is at its thinnest.",

Somewhere in it, a student’s concession is different from what the trustee remembers approving. When was it changed? By whom? On whose authority? The spreadsheet cannot answer, because a cell holds only its current value. The old value is gone, the editor’s name was never captured, and the reason was never written anywhere. In software language, the missing thing is called an audit trail: a running record of who changed what, when, and why.",
          "This matters most exactly where spreadsheets are used most: money. Fee disputes are rarely about dishonesty. They are about two honest people with two honest memories and no record to settle between them. When a parent insists the office quoted something different, or an auditor asks why one student’s dues differ from the published fee structure, the only evidence is the current state of the sheet — which is precisely the thing in question. Data integrity, meaning the confidence that a number is what it claims to be, cannot be reconstructed after the fact. It has to be recorded at the moment of change.",
          "To be fair: Google Sheets does keep a version history, and it is better than nothing. But it records that the file changed, not why, and reading it is archaeology — scrolling timestamps, comparing snapshots, guessing intent. It is not something a clerk can produce during a fee dispute at the counter, and it vanishes entirely the moment someone downloads the file and continues working in Excel. A history you cannot practically use in front of a parent or an auditor is not really a history.",

          "Here is the sentence some vendors save for the proposal call, and we would rather you read it first: a Founding Institutional Partner pilot is a paid, scoped commercial engagement. Scope, success measures, fees and conversion terms are agreed in writing before implementation begins. It is not a free trial. It is not an unlimited custom-development programme. It is a bounded piece of work with a written finish line, and money changes hands. No figure appears in this post or anywhere on our site, because the number depends on scope — but the fact of it should never be a surprise.",
          "We put this first for a practical reason. ‘Founding partner’ and ‘help shape the roadmap’ can reasonably sound like a free or subsidised arrangement. A trustee who forms that impression and then discovers otherwise on the first call trusts everything else we say a little less — and a pilot runs on trust from its opening week. Discovering the commercial reality here, in a blog post, costs nothing. Discovering it in front of your board costs the relationship its footing.",
          "The written agreement is also where the honesty runs in both directions. SquareCampus is a young company, and you should weigh that plainly rather than politely ignore it. The pilot structure exists because of that fact, not despite it: the scope is small, your current systems keep running, your data stays exportable throughout, and stopping at the end is a published outcome. Everything in the rest of this post is a protection you can hold us to on paper.",

A bottleneck is simply a place where work piles up — fees that take days to reconcile, admissions enquiries that stall between offices, reports that contradict each other. The pilot picks one, not five. If the first conversation surfaces several problems worth solving, we still start with one, because one problem can be measured and five can only be discussed.",
          "Small is not a limitation; it is the design. A pilot that spreads across the whole institution cannot finish inside a term, and a pilot that cannot finish cannot be judged. It quietly becomes a phased programme nobody agreed to, with a renewal conversation where a verdict should have been. Bounding the work is what makes the verdict possible — and the verdict, not the deployment, is the product of a pilot.",

It is written before implementation begins — not reconstructed afterwards, when memory has already picked a side. Alongside it, both sides agree one success measure: the single number or observable change the pilot will be judged against at the end.",
          "In practice this is not a research project. It is usually a few pages, drafted with your team during discovery. If the bottleneck is fee reconciliation, the baseline might record that closing a month currently takes the accounts office several working days across three systems, and name the person who carries that work. Nothing fancier is needed. What matters is that the starting position is on paper, agreed by the people who actually do the work, before the first login is created.",
          "Without a baseline, a pilot produces opinions instead of evidence. The vendor remembers the wins, the sceptics remember the glitches, and the closing meeting becomes a negotiation over what everyone recalls. With a baseline, the closing meeting is short: here is where we started, here is where we are, here is what we agreed success would look like. Institutions run on that kind of record everywhere else. A pilot should not be the exception.",

A principal, a trustee, a director, a registrar, a group leader. Not a committee, and not the most junior person who could be spared. The sponsor is the answer to a simple question every pilot eventually asks: when this needs a decision, who makes it? If that question has no one-name answer on day one, it will be answered by delay on day forty.",
          "The role is real work, though not heavy work. The sponsor convenes the people the workflow crosses, clears obstacles that staff cannot clear themselves, joins the weekly implementation reviews, and makes the convert, extend or stop decision at the end on the evidence. Where the sponsor’s authority is visible, staff treat the pilot as an institutional decision rather than an IT experiment happening to them — and that visibility does more for adoption than any feature.",
          "If no one senior will put their name on the outcome, the honest reading is that the institution does not want the change yet. That is worth knowing before money and staff time are committed, not after. It is one of the questions we ask directly in the first conversation, and one of the grounds on which we will suggest not proceeding.",

Your ERP or student information system remains the system of record — the system whose numbers are treated as final whenever two systems disagree. Your LMS keeps teaching, your payment portal keeps collecting, your identity provider keeps deciding who logs in. SquareCampus is deployed as a governed operating layer around the chosen bottleneck, not as a replacement for the estate. Nothing is switched off to find out whether this works.",

That is the same discipline described on the rollout page at squarecampus.com/rollout/, sequenced around admissions, fee deadlines, examinations and results. Where the AEGIS intelligence layer is part of the agreed scope, the same caution applies: it is role-scoped, grounded in your institution’s own records, auditable, and read-only in its first version. It is not a chatbot, and it does not act on its own.",
          "This is also, frankly, your protection against us. A young vendor asking you to switch off working systems is asking you to carry its risk. We are asking for something much narrower: run the pilot alongside what you have, compare the results, and keep complete exports of your data in standard formats available throughout — not only at the end.

A written baseline and a clean stop leave you better equipped for your next evaluation, whoever it is with. We think that is a fair floor for a pilot with a young company.",

Universities rarely lack software; they lose weeks in the gaps between systems that already exist.
