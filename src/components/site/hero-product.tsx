/**
 * Homepage hero product composition.
 *
 * Deliberately a Server Component and deliberately in normal document flow —
 * the previous version floated the phone and the AEGIS card with `absolute`,
 * which overlapped the command-centre screenshot between 1024px and 1279px and
 * reserved a large empty band beneath the hero.
 *
 * Composition rules:
 *  - The Admin / Trust Command Centre is always the dominant visual.
 *  - The laptop frame appears only at `lg` (`collapsible`). Below that it
 *    costs a quarter of the width to aluminium, which is what made the
 *    dashboard illegible on phones — so small screens get the screen in a
 *    plain rounded frame at full width instead.
 *  - One screen, no competing devices (audit SC-010): the phone and the
 *    animated AEGIS feed that used to sit beside it are gone, replaced by
 *    three annotations in body-size text.
 *  - One inline SVG renders the screen at every breakpoint; only the frame
 *    around it changes. Being inline is what lets the site's light/dark
 *    toggle reach inside it — an <img> is an isolated document and cannot
 *    see `data-theme` on the host <html>.
 *  - The frames are CSS (device-frames.tsx): no bezel image is requested at
 *    any breakpoint, and the aluminium follows the theme.
