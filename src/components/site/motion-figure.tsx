/**
 * Delivery wrapper for the build-time motion assets.
 *
 * Remotion renders these files during development (see `motion/README.md`);
 * nothing from Remotion reaches the browser. What ships is this component and
 * an ordinary `<video>` element.
 *
 * The rules it enforces, in the order they matter:
 *
 *  1. The poster is the real deliverable. It is the composition's meaningful
 *     final frame, it is in the markup from the first byte, and it is a
 *     complete picture on its own. Everything below is an enhancement.
 *  2. Nothing is downloaded until the figure is close to the viewport. The
 *     `<video>` is server-rendered with `preload="none"` and *no source at
 *     all*, so a below-the-fold asset cannot enter the initial critical path
 *     even if a browser ignores `preload`. The source is attached by an
 *     IntersectionObserver.
 *  3. `prefers-reduced-motion` and Save-Data never attach a source. Those
 *     visitors get the poster and no video bytes at all.
 *  4. It plays once and holds the final frame. `loop` is deliberately absent:
 *     an explanatory diagram that restarts forever is decoration.
 *  5. It pauses when scrolled substantially out of view.
 *  6. If anything fails — no JS, blocked media, a decode error — the poster
 *     stays. There is no blank box and no broken-media state.
 *
 * `loading="lazy"` is not defined for `<video>` (it is an `<img>`/`<iframe>`
 * attribute), so it is not emitted here; rule 2 achieves the same result
 * without shipping markup that only looks like it does something.
 *
 * Theme: each composition is rendered twice at build time. The markup carries
 * the light variant because the site's server-rendered default is light (the
 * theme script only switches to dark from localStorage, so a no-JS visitor is
 * always on light). Once mounted, this component follows `data-theme` — and
 * still fetches exactly one video, because the source is chosen after the
 * theme is known.
 *
 * The DOM around this component remains the authoritative explanation. When
 * `redundant` is true the figure is hidden from assistive technology, because
 * the adjacent copy already says the same thing.
