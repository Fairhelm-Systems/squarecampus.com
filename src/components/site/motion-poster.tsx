/**
 * The still form of a motion composition: the meaningful final frame, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * Used where the priority matrix says a page gets a storyboard rather than a
 * video (tier 2), and on the homepage — which already carries the command
 * centre and substantial HTML, and must not gain a second auto-starting asset.
 *
 * Deliberately a Server Component with no JavaScript at all. Both theme
 * variants are in the markup and CSS decides which one is displayed; because
 * both are `loading="lazy"`, the hidden one has no layout box, never
 * intersects the viewport, and is never fetched. One file on the wire, correct
 * in either theme, no hydration, no theme flash.
 *
 * Both images carry the same `alt`, and neither is `aria-hidden`: the inactive
 * one is `display: none`, so it is already out of the accessibility tree.
 * Marking one of them hidden unconditionally would silence the figure entirely
 * in whichever theme that one happened to be.
