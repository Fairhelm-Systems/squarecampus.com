    question: "What is a school management system?",
    answer:
      "A school management system is a unified platform that runs daily operations like admissions, attendance, fees, exams, communication, and compliance. SquareCampus is a school management system designed specifically for Indian schools so every stakeholder works from one source of truth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is SquareCampus different from legacy school ERPs?",
    answer:
      "Legacy ERPs bolt modules together and feel like separate products. SquareCampus is architected as one operating system: a unified institutional data model, consistent workflows, and human support included.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does SquareCampus handle Indian fee structures and compliance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We support complex fee terms, concessions, transport, late fees, GST, audit exports, and compliance-friendly audit trails. Multi-campus structures are built-in, not custom scripts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can we go live?",
    answer:
      "Rollout is guided and sequenced around your academic calendar. We import historical data, run a parallel dry run, train admins and teachers, and then go live with a rollback plan ready. Timelines depend on data complexity and are agreed before we start.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a mobile experience for parents and staff?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Parents get attendance, fees, transport, messages, and results in one app. Staff handle attendance, approvals, communication, and tasks without desktop friction.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is data secured inside the school management system?",
    answer:
      "Role-based access, scoped permissions, encryption in transit and at rest, activity logs, and export controls are part of the product design. Every action is traceable to a user and timestamp.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is school data protected and accessed securely?",
    answer:
      "Access is role-based and scoped by campus, department, and workflow. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and audit trails show every change with user and timestamp.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we see documentation for your security posture?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can share a security and compliance pack with data flow summaries, subprocessors, and incident response overview upon request.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support secure SSO integrations with our identity provider?",
    answer:
      "We are SSO-ready and can align with your identity provider for scoped, role-based access and streamlined onboarding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does pricing look like?",
    answer:
      "Transparent pricing based on students and staff. No per-module surprises, no hidden mobile fees, and implementation plus training are included.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can SquareCampus integrate with our existing tools?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We support SIS/finance exports, webhooks, and targeted integrations. If a critical integration is missing, we scope and ship it with clear timelines.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will teachers and admins need heavy training?",
    answer:
      "No. Interfaces follow existing workflows, not abstract menus. We deliver role-based onboarding, videos, and live sessions until adoption is steady.",
  },
