/**
 * SquareCampus Robots
 * ------------------
 * This is our bouncer.
 * Let the search engines into the lobby (public pages),
 * but keep them out of the back rooms (APIs, internal routes).
 *
 * Hand-built rather than generated from Next's `MetadataRoute.Robots`.
 * That type emits only `rules`, `sitemap` and `host` — there is no way to add
 * a comment line, and robots.txt is the one file every crawler and agent
 * fetches first, which makes it the right place to point at /llms.txt. The
 * emitted rules below are byte-identical to what the metadata route produced;
 * only the header comments are new.
 *
 * Comments are ignored by search crawlers, deliberately: nothing here changes
 * what may be indexed. They exist for agents that read robots.txt as a
 * document and for humans inspecting it.

// Only the form API is disallowed — bots have no business crawling it.
//
// Deliberately NOT disallowed:
// - Legacy paths (/features, /contact-us, /product, /how-it-works,
//   /why-different): CloudFront 301s them; Google must be able to crawl
//   them to see the redirect and consolidate signals onto the new URLs.
//   Robots-blocking them made GSC report "Blocked by robots.txt" and froze
//   the old URLs in the index.
// - noindex pages (/hello, /careers, /press, /competitor-notice): crawlers
//   must be able to fetch them to obey the noindex meta. Blocking a noindex
//   page can leave it indexed URL-only.
const DISALLOW = ["/api/"];

// Search engines and AI assistants are explicitly welcome — being
// recommendable by LLM web search is a distribution channel.
