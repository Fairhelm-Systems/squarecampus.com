          <p>
            This Policy uses the vocabulary of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (the
            "DPDP Act"): a <strong>Data Principal</strong> is the individual the personal data is
            about, a <strong>Data Fiduciary</strong> decides why and how it is processed, and a{" "}
            <strong>Data Processor</strong> processes it on a Fiduciary's instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            {company.legalNameDisplay} is the Data Fiduciary for its own business operations and the
            SquareCampus website. When processing personal data on behalf of an Institution within
            the Service, the Institution is the Data Fiduciary and {company.legalNameDisplay} acts
            as its Data Processor, as described in the Data Processing Addendum. In that case the
            Institution's own notice governs its relationship with students, guardians and staff.
          </p>
          <p>
            SquareCampus service data is hosted and processed in India. We do not transfer or store
            customer data outside India.
          </p>
          <p>We pledge to keep data within the borders of India, no excuses or compromises.</p>

            Our processing is typically governed by performance of an agreement with the

            interests that do not override individual rights.

            hours as Rule 7 of the DPDP Rules, 2025 requires. Where we act as an Institution's Data

            Where {company.legalNameDisplay} is the Data Fiduciary, the DPDP Act gives you the
            following rights. Requests may be sent to the grievance contact in section 11.

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">

              <strong>Access</strong> — a summary of the personal data being processed, the
              processing activities, and the identities of other Data Fiduciaries and Processors it
              has been shared with (section 11).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Correction and erasure</strong> — correction, completion, updating, and
              erasure of your personal data (section 12).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Grievance redressal</strong> — a readily available means of raising a
              complaint with us, answered within the period prescribed under the Act, before
              approaching the Data Protection Board of India (section 13).

            <li>
              <strong>Nomination</strong> — the right to nominate another individual to exercise

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdrawal of consent</strong> — where processing rests on your consent, you
              may withdraw it at any time, with the same ease as it was given. Withdrawal stops
              further processing for that purpose; it does not undo lawful processing already
              carried out, nor affect records we must retain by law.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where your data sits inside an Institution's deployment, that Institution is the Data
            Fiduciary. Raise the request with the Institution first; we will support it as the
            Institution's Data Processor. We may need to verify your identity, and your authority
            where you act for someone else, before acting on a request.

        <LegalSection title="10. Children’s and Student Data" id="children">
          <p>
            Student records are the most sensitive data SquareCampus touches, and a large share of
            them concern children — anyone under eighteen. Section 9 of the DPDP Act requires
            verifiable consent from a parent or lawful guardian before a child's personal data is
            processed, and prohibits tracking, behavioural monitoring, and targeted advertising
            directed at children. Rule 10 of the DPDP Rules, 2025 adds that the consent must be
            genuinely verifiable: due diligence is required to confirm that the person giving it is
            an identifiable adult entitled to act for the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            SquareCampus is provided to Institutions, not directly to children. The Institution
            holds the relationship with students and guardians and is responsible for obtaining and
            recording verifiable parental consent, for managing access on behalf of students, and
            for its own compliance regarding minors. Our role is to process what the Institution
            instructs and to make that instruction boundary enforceable in the product.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
            <li>We do not sell student, child, or guardian data, or share it for advertising.</li>

              We do not track, profile, or behaviourally monitor children, and run no advertising
              technology in the product.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not use student or child data to train AI models. The AEGIS posture is

            <li>
              We undertake no processing that is likely to have a detrimental effect on the
