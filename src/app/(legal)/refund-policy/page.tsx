          <EntityIdentity documentNoun="this Policy" />
          <p>
            SquareCampus is sold to institutions under signed agreements — subscriptions,
            implementation and rollout work, and data or integration services. There is no
            self-service checkout, and no purchase can be completed on this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page states the default position. Where a signed order form, subscription
            agreement, or statement of work sets different cancellation, refund, or termination
            terms, that signed document controls for its subject matter.
          </p>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="2. Subscription Cancellation" id="subscriptions">
          <p>
            Subscription terms run for the period stated in the order form and renew only as that
            document provides.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
            <li>
              An Institution may cancel at any time by written notice, effective at the end of the
              current paid term.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notice given at least thirty days before a renewal date stops that renewal. Notice
              given later takes effect at the end of the following term.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fees already paid for the current term are not refunded on cancellation for
              convenience, and the Service remains available until the term ends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where SquareCampus materially fails to provide the Service and does not remedy the
              failure within a reasonable cure period after written notice, the Institution may
              terminate and receive a pro-rata refund of fees paid for the unserved remainder of the
              term.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </LegalSection>

        <LegalSection title="3. Implementation and Services" id="services">
          <p>
            Rollout, implementation, migration, integration, and support engagements are quoted and
            invoiced against a statement of work.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
            <li>
              Work billed on a time-and-materials basis is payable for effort delivered up to the
              effective date of cancellation; unearned advances are refunded.
            </li>
            <li>
              Milestone-based work is payable for milestones accepted before cancellation. Amounts
              paid against a milestone that was neither delivered nor accepted are refunded.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-recoverable third-party costs already committed on the Institution's instruction —
              licences, cloud commitments, hardware — are not refundable, and are itemised in the
              final reconciliation.
            </li>
            <li>
              On termination, customer data is returned or deleted as the applicable agreement and
              the Data Processing Addendum require, regardless of any fee dispute.

            <a href={`mailto:${company.email.general}`}>{company.email.general}</a>, or by post to
            the registered office above. Include the Institution name, the agreement or invoice
            reference, the effective date sought, and the reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            We acknowledge a request within three working days and confirm the outcome, with a

        <LegalSection title="5. How Approved Refunds Are Paid" id="how-refunds-are-paid">
          <p>
            Approved refunds are paid to the originating bank account or payment instrument used for
            the original payment, in the currency of the original invoice. We do not issue refunds
            in cash or to a third-party account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds are initiated within seven working days of approval. The time taken for the
            amount to reach the account depends on the Institution's bank or payment provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds are net of applicable taxes and bank charges, and any credit note is issued in
            accordance with applicable GST rules.
