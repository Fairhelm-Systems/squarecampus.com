// Build-time generator for per-page Open Graph cards (1200x630).
//
// Renders on-brand typographic cards with the real Sora / IBM Plex fonts via
// next/og's ImageResponse (satori + resvg under the hood — fonts are passed as
// buffers, so no system-font install is needed). Output is committed PNGs in
// public/og; this is run manually when card copy changes, matching the existing
// static-card pattern (public/og/services-card.png stays hand-designed).
//
//   bun scripts/og-cards/generate.mjs [slug]   # one card, or all if omitted
//
// Cards for content-driven routes (search-intent pages, comparisons) are
// derived from the same typed content the pages render from, so their copy
// cannot drift. Palette is the site's dark theme: the site defaults to dark,
// and a share preview should look like the page it opens.
